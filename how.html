                <h2>How it Works</h2>
		<p> We work to provide hassle free research and development by making everything as streamlined as possible: someone emails us an idea,
			we reply to them to clarify design requirements, then we assign the project to one or more of our team members. 
                <br>
		    <p> As of now, our process has not been formalized as we are still working through what works best for our 
		    customers and our developers. This is an iterative process and each product that we build provides lessons 
		    learned that we can apply to the next time someone asks us for help. Our current process is described below, 
		    but we are working on migrating to something more structured so that our operations can scale better. </p>
		    <br>
		    <p> Our end goal is to make it so that the process is as easy to understand as possible, while taking no more than 
			    5 minutes for someone to submit an idea. If you have thoughts on ways we can do this, or feedback on how to make
		    our current low tech system work better, we would greatly appreciate it. </p>
