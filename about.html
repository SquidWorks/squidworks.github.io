                <p> <i>"In 2016, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. 
			These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Annapolis underground. 
			Today, still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune.
			If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The A-Team." </i></p>
		    <p> We are some people who like doing things, and since we were all going to be doing side projects during our
			    free time anyway, we might as well do something worthwhile with them. </p> 
		        <p> We do stuff for the people who do stuff
			    and that's our way of doing our part outside of our day jobs. </p>
