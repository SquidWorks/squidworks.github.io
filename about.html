                <h2>About Squid Works</h2>
                <p>I created this site because while teaching yourself how to be a hacker is hard, teaching yourself how to be a hacker the right way is even harder. </p>
                <p>Squid Works is the child of a decade of attempting to find resources online to expand my knowledge. There is no lack of resources, but rather, there is a lack of flow, a lack of coherent frameworks and training plans. And while going a rambling on the internet works for some people, it doesn't work for most of us. I instantly gravitated towards Hack Forums and Hack This Site. Plenty of others did as well, but significantly more simply quit because they thought they didn't know enough and could never learn all the material out there. </p>
                <p>The simple fact of the matter is that noone can even approach knowing a fraction of what there is to know about this domain, however, this site aims to give students the tools required to navigate anything thrown at them. By repeatedly stressing that students are not expected to show up being elite hackers, or to leave as elite hackers, this site attempts to fill the gap between "I want to cyber" and "I cyber".</p>
				<p>All we hope to do here is to provide guidance for the first 6 months of your journey into cyberspace, after that, we hope to have given you the tools, techniques, and hacker mentality required to address any problem that comes your way. </p>

				<p>Cyber is hard, cyber is fun. People show up thinking they don't know anything. People freak out and realize they knew less than they thought they did. People leave. We don't like that. Don't leave. </p>
