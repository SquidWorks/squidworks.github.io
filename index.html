                        <p>This site is based off of a totally not peer reviewed study on educational theory for self guided technical learning. I taught myself and I’ve taught others for the last three years and identified a ton of problems, so I designed this site to address them. Eventually I'll get around to actually doing a formal study on this.</p>
