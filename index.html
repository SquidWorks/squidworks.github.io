		    <p> We are a research and developemnt shop that works to develop and enhance
			    technical capabilities at the tactical level using open source software
			    and COTS hardware. We will provide free R&D to anyone who asks, free of charge,
			    on any subject. Everything we do is unclass, 
			    but we do not advertise who we work for, and any member of any organization can send us a request. 
			    We don't care about rank, there is no drawn out approval process or contracting requirements, 
			    just email us at <a href="mailto:squidworks@protonmail.com">squidworks@protonmail.com</a> to get started. </p>

                        <p>We make the process as simple as possible: someone emails us an idea, we contact them to clarify and 
			    clarify design requirements, then we assign the project to one or more of our team members. This 
			    simplified development process optimizes our speed, allowing us to make us much of an impact as possible.</p>

                        <p> You or someone in your organization has a list of problems, and an even longer list of ideas on how to
			    fix those problems. Your R&D team has priorities and can't get to them all, or maybe you don't have a 
				team dedicated to maximizing your effectiveness. Luckily, all you have to do is email us that 
				list of problem and idea pairs and we can get to work. </p>
