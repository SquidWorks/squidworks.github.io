                <h2 class="page-header">Welcome to the Squid Works Dojo!</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>There is no lack of incredible resources available online to teach yourself how to do incredible things on computers, I’ll be the first to admit that. I’m a self taught hacker, started as a script kiddie in middle school hanging out on Hackforums, and a few years later making it to the big leagues as the Naval Academy’s Cyber Security Team’s Training Officer, with a decade or so of trying to figure out what I was doing mixed in between. </p> 
				<p>So why another online training site? For all of the great resources out there, and all of the incredible pieces of training, nothing walks a complete beginner all the way through the process of developing a strong foundation in the fundamentals. Everyone wants to learn how to cyber, but very quickly they realize that there is no way for them to learn everything. They’re not wrong, the vast and constantly expanding body of knowledge about this field makes it impossible for anyone to keep up. But what is most important for the beginner to realize is that with the proper knowledge of the fundamentals and a firm grasp on the hacker mentality, that irrepressible drive to learn and to do, nothing is too complex for them to learn if they put the time in. </p>
				<p><strong>Squid Works Core Tenets:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No initial expectation of knowledge</li>
                    <li>Understanding foundational theory comes before building technical skills</li>
                    <li>Developing fundamental technical skills lays the groundwork for future success</li>
                    <li>Knowledge must be actionable</li>
                    <li>There is no “I Believe” button</li>
                    <li>The measure of a community is how they treat those who are trying to gain entry</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By managing new learners’ expectations of themselves, providing constant quantified feedback on their progress, and bringing them into the community, Squid Works is designed to minimize dropout rate while providing the best first hundred hours of a cyber security education possible.</p>
				
				<p>Why one hundred hours? In our experience, if someone gets through one hundred hours of learning in this field they have the knowledge required to figure out what the next ten thousand of hours is asking them to learn, the skills required to learn how to solve the next ten thousand hours of problems, and most importantly the confidence required to face the infinite vastness of this domain. </p>

                        <p>This site is based off of a totally not peer reviewed study on educational theory for self guided technical learning. I taught myself and I’ve taught others for the last three years and identified a ton of problems, so I designed this site to address them. Eventually I'll get around to actually doing a formal study on this.</p>
