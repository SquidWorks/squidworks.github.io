                <h2>The Purpose of Competition</h2>
                <p>While we do our best to teach challenging material, nothing pushes the envelope of what you are capable of like a competition. Competitions are time compressed learning coupled with the application of your skills and knowledge. There is room on any of our teams for newcomers and experts alike, and the teamwork and collaboration skills that you will pick up training for and competing in these events are among the most valuable you can learn. While all of the team members may not be located in the same place, the vast majority of competitions we compete in are remote and allow collaboration with the experts who mentor (and compete with) each team.</p>

We are hoping to turn this team into a super group of competitors from a large number of teams who can compete on this team whenever they want to do an event their team doesn’t have the manpower for.
