                <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
                <p>The more people we have working on these problems the better, so we are always trying to recruit more people for our 
			community. If you are able to contribute in any way, technical or non-technical, shoot us an email, we'll talk 
			for a bit and go over who you are and what your skills are, and 
			we will put you down on our list of members. When a project comes our way, we float it by members who are able to
			work on it. Don't worry about not being an expert, we are all amateurs who take pride in our work. </p>
			
		    <p>As our <a href="https://squidworks.github.io/about.html" >About page</a> says, we all do this on the side of our 
			    day jobs. You might wind up making money
			    but we do this to help people out and because it's fun. You can almost definitely do this 
			    in addition to your actual job because everything we do is at the unclass level, which 
				minimizes risk, not to mention paperwork. </p>
