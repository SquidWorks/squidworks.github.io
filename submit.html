                <h2>How to Submit Problems and Ideas</h2>
                <p> If you have something you need worked on and you want it in the next month, we are your people. 
		  There are no contracts, no paperwork, no commitment, we make things for free because we like helping out the good guys. 
		    We don't ask who you are unless you want to tell us, and we keep everything we do confidential.</p>
		 <p> We specialize in development for offensive and defensive cyber operations, but we'll do basically anything if you want
			 us to work on it. If it involves computers, wires, antennae, or circuit boards, we can probably figure it out. <p>
		    <p> We also do consulting work and will do penetration testing and vulnerability assessment as well as paper editing and 
			    fact-checking. It's always better for the good guys to attack you first, and we bring that adversarial advantage 
			    to the table. </p>
		    <p> If you want custom training, let us know. We have plenty of experience making tutorials, classes, and training tools for
			    various topics and skill levels. </p>
		    <p> Basically, we'll do anything if you tell us you want it, we just want to help out! </p>
